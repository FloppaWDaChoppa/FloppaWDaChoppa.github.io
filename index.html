								<h2>1. How will you continue learning about computer science?</h2>
								<p>As technology advances and improves, computer science becomes increasingly more prevalentin our lives. It already surrounds us, in our cars, our phones, our applicances, our schools and our workplace. With the rapid emergence and development of new technology, learning about computer science gives me beneficial skills and can help me find employment in software, hardware, consumer electronics, robotics and other growing technology-related industries more easily. <br> <br> I can continue learning about computer science by using the online resources I have been working with throughout this course such as Khan Academy and Codecademy. Alternatively, I can seek out other online educational options to further expand my knowledge and understanding of computer science. Additionally, I will be able to take post secondary computer science courses, workshops, and other learning opportunities to build on my current knowledge. As technology advances and our lives become more immersed and connected with it, it is increasingly important to learn about computer science because this knowledge will prove to be a useful tool in the future and become a siginifant part of our lives.</p> <hr>
								<h2>2. Summarize your experience with Khan Academy.</h2>
								<p>Khan Academy is the leading online learning resource used and trusted by US teachers and students. Khan academy is a well known and has a reputation for being an effective learning resource across a multitude of subjects, more than any other core curriculum online learning resource. Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and sperately from class time but further reinforcing knowledge from lessons learned in the classroom. <br> <br> My experience with khan academy was a satisfactory experience overall, however I do have some complaints and criticisms. On one hand I enjoyed Khan Academy's learning structure complete with practice exercises, instructional videos, and even a personalized learning dashboard for students to easily navigate, keep track of progress and set goals. However, I personally found it very hard to keep my momentum when I was working with Khan Academy as it lacked a lot of engagement and did not really have any means of encouraging or motivating students to keep working. It felt like my learning was just a checklist. I did not enjoy using it as a learning tool as it lacks the capability to keep students interested with their instructional format of reading articles then straight onto application whilst expanding of the items your just read and learned about. It is frustrating and not a very effective learning procedure. However, it does get the job done and taught me all the basic fundamentals concepts and applications of Javascript in computer science.</p><hr>
								<h2>3. What does it mean to have good programming practices?</h2>
								<p>How you write code is a large part of your programming capabilities throughout your career or computer science pursued education. Developing a coding style that’s mindful of these best practices will make it easier to debug, refactor and scale the code in the future. It’s important to employ good programming practices early on to help ensure you develop good habits and consistently program with better quality code for yourself and for anyone who may have to extend that code in the future. <br> <br>
								Having good programming practices means being mindful of your code and it's structure. This entails the efficiency and organization of your code in terms of readability for your peers and/or teachers as well as the execution of your code. It is crucial to have well written, organized and efficient code such that it is easy to read so that you can easily identify errors and for yourself and others to understand your code. Well written, organized and efficient code is also important in the sense that your code is properly structured so that it is easy to refactor and improve. In my experience, my programming practice can use work on very simple mistakes like mal-nesting, documentation and indentation; small, nit-picky things but they add up and when you are coding, especially if your mind is unorganized and scattered as your code will reflect that and it can get messy really quick.</p><hr>

								<h1 class="major">My Top 10 Modules</h1>
								<span class="image main"><img src="https://bs-uploads.toptal.io/blackfish-uploads/components/seo/content/og_image_file/og_image/737534/0810_Creating_Truly_Modular_Code_Lina_Social-a3c9aca70c51d6539b1c1eaaefb557a2.png" alt="" /></span>

								<h2>1. Codecademy: Learn Git and Github</h2>
								<p>Learning Git and Github on codecademy taught me how to effectively organize and collaborate with peers on programming projects. I have learned the basic function of Git and Github such as how to make changes, stage files, commit changes, branch, merge, pull, and rewrite repository history. These essential aspects of the module had the most significant impact on me as I used these skills multiple times throughout the entire course and even on this portfolio now. I will continue to use programming in Git and Github to learn as a student by sharing my work and collaborating with others.</p>

								<h2>2. Codecademy: Create a Front-end App with React</h2>
								<p>Learning to create a front-end app with React has taught me how to make functional, interactive user interfaces and develop visual elements of a webpage. I have learned skills specific to the web application framework React, but broad in concept that I can apply to web-design which is so in-demand right now. I will continue to use programming in creating front-end apps to learn as a student by applying what I’ve learned to make my coding projects more creative and interactive.</p>

								<h2>3. Codecademy: Create a Back-End App with Javascript</h2>
								<p>Learning to create a back-end app with Javascript has taught me how things function behind the scenes of websites and how they work for users. The aspect of applying my current knowledge of loops, functions, iterators, objects and modules connected to back end server development was the most significant because it is something I already know and can expand on. I will continue to use programming in creating back end apps to learn as a student by applying what I’ve learned to games where I could employ the use of a back-end to improve server experience on a multiplayer platform for me and my friends.</p>

								<h2>4. Khan Academy: Computer Science - Algorithms</h2>
								<p>Learning algorithms was essential in my overall understanding of computer science throughout the course. It had many applications to concepts we learned such as recursion, sorting, arrays, and graph theory. The most significant impact to me of this module was definitely cubing. I was never able to solve any cube before, and now I could solve everything up to a 3x3x3 consistently. I think cubing was the perfect activity to set us up for algorithms as it was a tangible and fun activity to connect us to immediate applications with computer science.  I will continue my exploration of algorithms by learning and mastering different kinds of cubes to further increase my understanding and mastery of algorithms.</p>

								<h2>5. Khan Academy: Natural Simulations</h2>
								<p>Learning natural simulations was an application of skills I learned in JavaScript and physics concepts to them, such as vectors and forces, as well as random variable manipulation to simulate nature in programming. The most significant aspect of this module was vectors because I was also doing physics in the same semester so I had some knowledge of how it worked and it was really something to go from drawing vectors on paper to simulating them in programming. I will continue to use natural simulations to learn as I am considering animation and want to start using applications like blender where I will need to apply my knowledge in natural simulations to simulate particles and material behaviour.</p>

								<h2>6. Khan Academy: Vectors</h2>
								<p>Learning vectors was an opportunity for me to apply what I’ve learned in physics and translate it from paper into seeing it in real-time in simulations. The most significant aspect of this module was the realistic application inside of a simulation, it really sets the foundation for creating a convincing simulation. I will continue to use vectors to further my learning by adding on extra layers to enhance the code as in vector addition/subtraction for multiple pathways or extrapolating the concept from 2D vectors to 3D vectors.</p>

								<h2>7. Khan Academy: Forces</h2>
								<p>Similarly to vectors, learning forces on khan academy was also an opportunity for me to apply what I’ve learned in physics and translate it from theory into experiencing it in simulations. The most significant aspect of this module was messing around with the magnitude of forces and seeing how it behaves in the simulation. It was really fun applying it to the spaceship and creature behaviour projects. I will continue to use force to further my learning by again extrapolating the concept from 2D forces to 3D forces as well as implement a lot more forces in tandem that would be present in a more realistic simulation.</p>

								<hr>

								<h2>8. Khan Academy: Particle Systems</h2>
								<p>A particle system is a collection of many many minute particles that together represent a fuzzy object. Over a period of time, particles are generated into a system, move and change from within the system, and die from the system. This module taught me how to implement strategies for programming a particle system as well as distinctions between single particles, particle systems and other particle types as well as how to apply forces to them. The most significant aspect of this module was the visual creativity I was able to express by combining vectors, forces and randomizing variables to create a realistic particle system. I can continue learning about particle systems by exploring options in animation programs where I can use what iU've learned and apply it in a fun, visual way. </p>

								<h2>9. Hackathon</h2>
								<p>The hackathon was a fun assignment that gave the opportunity for me and my group members to get creative and inventive with what we wanted to do. The most significant impact of the Hackathon was the collaboration as it was our first project where we had to use github and collaborate in a true coding setting. I can use my experience from the hackathon to learn more about github as a tool for collaboration within programming and to make sure it is a lot more functional in the future as this was our first rundown.

								<h2>10. Creative Coding Challenge</h2>
								<p>The creative coding challenge was a neat project. It was interesting to select from a multitude of challenges we could choose for ourselves and really push ourselves to see what we can do. The most significant aspect of this module was the refactoring because after you successfully replicate the code and gain a solid understanding of the concepts, the next step is naturally to improve on it and challenge yourself. The refactoring left a lot of creativity for the students and it was really fun seeing what we improved on. I will continue using my experience from the Coding Challenge to learn about other concepts to challenge myself. I think it is good practice to push yourself to learn more, and the creative coding challenge followed a great format which allowed for that. So I could chose another project to replicate and make sure I fully understand how it works, then improve on it to see what I’m capable of.</p>
